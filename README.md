# Writing Prompts

Practice writing each day for 20 minutes.

## Writing

The writing will be stored in the `writing` directory, where each day is a separate directory.  Inside of each will be a file called `prompt.md`.  To add your writing for the day, simply make a file with your name (e.g. `michael-bentley.md`).

## Prompt Ideas

To suggest more ideas for prompts, please visit the [future-prompts](future-prompts.md) page.

## Reviewing

We have not yet decided how reviewing will work.  But the reviews will either be via email or perhaps placed inside of a folder called `reviews`.

## Markdown Help

For those who are unfamiliar with how to write Markdown, [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is a cheatsheet.  Of course, you will not need to do anything too complicated such as tables or figures, as these are merely writing exercises.
