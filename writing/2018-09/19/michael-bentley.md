Elderly Drivers

With advanced age comes the diminished ability to observe the world and react.
Perhaps sharing the road with such people may increase danger to the community.
Some have proposed the idea of requiring those who have reached a certain age to reapply for their driving license.
This proposal is given in the hopes that those who would pose a risk to the community would be rejected and removed from the population of drivers.

There are some very serious concerns with such an approach.
First, is it actually confirmed that the elderly pose a higher risk to traffic than the rest of the population?
As many can attest, often when driving behind a slow vehicle, as soon as you pass them, you recognize that they are frequently elderly.
As people age, they become painfully aware of limitations they never had before;
they learn to cope with these limitations.
In my experience, many elderly people behave more cautiously because they recognize these limitations.
Cautiousness is a desirable attribute in a safe driver.
When considering this extra dimension to the equation, it is no longer obvious that elderly pose a higher risk than those more capable, but less cautious drivers on the road.

Another serious concern is that of prejudice.
Is it ageist to create a policy that singles out the aging population?
Ageism is discrimination against an individual purely because of their age.
If it were desirable to create a policy for the elderly to reapply for driving licenses, it would need to be done in a way that does not discriminate against their age.
This would require some sort of policy such as a blanket required reapplication after every 10 or 20 years, regardless of age.
Although that may be annoying to many, it may decrease traffic crashes and violations.
This kind of policy would have the added benefit of reminding all who share the road how to be safe and to follow traffic laws.
I once had to take a traffic course in order to get a ticket removed from my record, and from the experience, I believe all drivers would benefit from such a course on a regular basis.
This I am in favor of, not simply because of the elderly, but because of other bad drivers out there.

The policy to single out the elderly to reapply for drivers licenses has some serious flaws.
It is unclear this would improve the safety in a significant way.
Also, how could a policy be created that does not discriminate against age?
Before suggesting such a policy, these concerns should be addressed by scientific means.
