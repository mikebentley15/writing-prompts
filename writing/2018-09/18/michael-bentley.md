Television violence

Many of us love our own Netflix shows.
For some, it is the Great British Baking Show; for others, the next superhero series.
Some of our favorite blockbusters and television shows have an excessive amount of violence.
Does this violence affect those that view it?

Whether we are aware or not, we can become desensitized to extreme violence.
For those who are not satisfied with the violence encountered in television and movies, there are plenty of violent video games to choose from where instead of simply viewing violence, one acts it out.
In the shows and video games, violence is not merely displayed and abhorred.
Instead, the violence is encouraged and applauded, such as with spies, in war scenarios, and with a superhero saving the day.

The habit centers of our brains are wired to recognize positive reinforcement and to begin the habit loop.
The habit loop then seeks out the triggers for the positive reinforcement, to again be rewarded.
And thus develops the habit and desensitization toward violence.

What kinds of effects can this desensitization have?
For starters, those who commit violence are given ideas of how to perform their acts.
This can be seen in pipe bombs and mass shootings -- events for which many would not occur if the perpetrator were not given the idea.
Some may argue that if they were not given that idea, they would have expressed violence in other ways.
Even if that were true, the final effects would not be nearly as severe as the mass shootings and terrorism we experience in today's world.

Although there may not be obvious signs of exposing violence to many in the public, there are some who take the message to a higher extreme.
The world would be better off without these acts of violence we experience in our society.
But are we willing to give up our sources of entertainment for this minority who moves toward the extremes?
Is it fair to the rest of us to give that up because some cannot handle it?
On the other hand, are there non-obvious effects to the rest of us from the constant exposure to violence?
I don't have all of the answers, but it is clear violence has a strong influence on today's culture.
