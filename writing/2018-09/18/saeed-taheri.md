Nothing is perfect in this world and everything comes with pros and cons, including television or "broadcaster", as a more general concept. 

However, TV is one of the easiest things out there to measure its pros and cons and I believe its advantages can help society, many times more than its disadvantages hurt.

From a social-wise point of view, every member of society should be able to see both/all sides of daily life around the society and world. And TV is one of the ways to do so.
Even if you want to see only daily world news from TV, there are a lot of sad news about violent actions around the world by different people.

Violence is part of human and one can not deny it by ignoring it or pretend that it is not there.
Consequently, human need to learn how to control it and direct it in a harmless way.
And that is when the role of TV and other social media or broadcasters becomes essential.

In addition to positive cultural impact that TV can have on society by teaching and infroming parents how to raise their child peacfully,
 TV can also impact laws and regulations to be preventible enough to keep people away from crime and violence.
