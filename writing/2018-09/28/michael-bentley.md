Being in a large city, you may not be too familiar with wildlife.
Sure, there may be trees, grass, and the occasional animal.
You may have even been to barbecues or camped in a park.
But that is no replacement for the wild.


My experience is more with canyons, lakes, and mountains.
The beauty is breathtaking.
The pristine clear water, the greenery as far as the eye can see, the undeniable hand of creation.
There is a reason so much art is focused on the simple beauty of nature.


There is nothing quite like the quiet of nature.
When within the city, and constantly surrounded by people and technology, there is almost never quiet.
It seems that there is always some electrical hum, or plumbing hiss, coming from somewhere at all times.
It may not even be noticeable since it is a constant.
Not so when in the outdoors.
You can hear the babble of a brook, the chirping of a bird, the breeze blowing across the trees.
It is an amazing environment to think, to read, ponder and meditate.


But outdoor living is not comprised solely of going outside and taking in the beauty of nature.
It is hard work.
Probably much harder work than you may be accustomed.
Every meal is a burden.
If you bring your own food with you, wood needs to be chopped, gathered, and utilized to construct a fire.
If you do not bring your own food, you resort to gathering, fishing, or hunting.


There are also many dangers to outdoor living.
Many berries and mushrooms look delicious, but turn out to be poisonous.
Even poison ivy and poison oak can cause very itchy rashes if you happen to brush your skin against their leaves.
I will say that if you go on an outdoor venture, be sure to bring someone experienced along with you as a guide.
The wild can be ruthless and cruel.
Caution is always advised, especially since you cannot simply call an ambulance if something does go awry.


Nature is a wonderful place to be.
But, it is good to recognize that there are very good reasons we developed cities and homes.
Nature is a wild place that is unforgiving.
There is a part of all of us that longs to be within a natural setting.
Just be sure to be careful and try to go with someone experienced.
Experiencing outdoor living in a careful and thoughtful way is extremely rewarding and is recommended to all.
