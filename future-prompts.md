- There are seven laws of the harvest.  Choose one of them and tell of a time
  in your life where you saw this law demonstrated strongly.  (See
  [this article from bible.org](https://bible.org/article/seven-laws-harvest))
    1. We reap only what has been sown
    2. We reap the same in kind as we sow
    3. We reap in a different season than we sow
    4. We reap more than we sow
    5. We reap in proportion to what we sow
    6. (specific to good and evil, we'll skip it...)
    7. We can't do anything about last year's harvest, but we can about this
       year's
  Although this is discussed in religious circles, many of the principles are
  universally true.
